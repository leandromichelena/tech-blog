Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 14. A blog built following the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure. It uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## About This Repository
This repository contains the working files for the Coding Bootcamp Weekly Challenge 14. <br>
The objective of this exercise is to apply the concepts learned during the module 14 Model-View-Controller (MVC). The application runs on Node.js and was deployed to Heroku. It is a CMS style blog. The API and HTML routes were created using Express.js. The database was built using MySQL and is managed using the npm package mysql2. And the front-end was created using Handlebars.
